# Grader Program

This helps me grade assignments faster. clone_all.py, names.py, grade_all.py were files provided to me by my professor I worked for. I just edited grade_all.py and names.py to be more useful.

## Features

clone_all.py 
- clones everyone's repository to my computer. based on names in the names.py file

grade_all.py 
- checks if the local repository is up to date, if not pulls again from github.
- runs each person's repository in order according to the names.py list allowing me to grade in order
my contributions to grade_all.py
- added a search feature to jump down the list to start grading from where I left off
